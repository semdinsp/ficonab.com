        I use [Mathematica](http://wolfram.com) for most of our technology development
  
        If you are interested in a bridge between [Mathematica](http://wolfram.com) and [Interactive Brokers ](http://interactivebrokers.com) please contact me for a reasonably priced solution or a free trial. Sample mathematica code is shown below:
      
            ibConnection = ibFiconabSimpleWrapper[]; 
            ibAccountValueHash = {}; 
            ibAccountPortfolioHash = {}; 
            ibOrderHash = {}; 
            orderId = ibPlaceCompleteOrder[ibConnection, "GM", "STK", "BUY", 250, "LMT", 33.2, accountName, "algoName"]
            
  
        I also use [ruby](http://ruby-lang.org) for website and integrated performance reporting.  Most of our reporting and database tools are hosed on Amazon.com services including Amazon's RDS and EC2 services.

        We have recently deployed this site to [Heroku](http://heroku.com) in preparation for a production deployment.  I was able to deploy this website in production mode in 55 minutes without any experience of Heroku so I think that is a pretty fantastic product.
